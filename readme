NAME
    File::ReadEvt

VERSION
    Version 0.1

DESCRIPTION
    File::ReadEvt - Perl module to parse parse/read Windows Event Log 
    files without using the MS Windows API.  This is useful in cases in which
    the Event Log files are determined by the MS API (ie, EventViewer, psloglist.exe
    from SysInternals.com) to be corrupt.  
    
    This module provides the functions and basis for tools to parse Event Log files via
    web-based (PHP) interfaces, as well as for dumping to another format (.txt, .xls), and
    deriving statistics.

DEPENDENCIES
